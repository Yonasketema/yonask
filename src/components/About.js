            Hello!my name is yonas. I like blending colors to create new ones.
            My fascination with web programming began when a friend showed me a
            hello world html web page. That day inspired me to succeed as a web
            developer. On this particular day, I created my own full-stack app.
            Working on my own projects is something I like doing. My birthplace
            is Ethiopia, where design began in a cave. This led me to seek for
            my own design system, habesha theme, in order to present you with a
            more distinct and engaging experience .

          <div
            style={{
              width: "max(10rem, 21vw)",
              height: "60vh",
              borderRadius: "30vh",
              backgroundImage: `linear-gradient(to top,#ffc94242,#ffc94247), url(${me})`,
              marginBottom: "1rem",
              backgroundPosition: "center",
              backgroundSize: "cover",
