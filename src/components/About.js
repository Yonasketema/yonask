            Hello!my name is yonas. I like blending colors to create new ones.
            My fascination with web programming began when a friend showed me a
            hello world html web page. That day inspired me to succeed as a web
            developer. On this particular day, I created my own full-stack app.
            Working on my own projects is something I like doing. My birthplace
            is Ethiopia, where design began in a cave. This led me to seek for
            my own design system, habesha theme, in order to present you with a
            more distinct and engaging experience .

              borderRadius: "30vh",
